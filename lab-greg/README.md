I have built four functions for this assignment.  All of which resemble basic array prototype methods.

The first function is a map function.  This expects an array and a callback function as it's parameters.  The result in this case will take every value in an array and multiply it by 2.

The second function is a filter function.  It takes in an array and a callback as it's parameters.  The result should filter out the delcared value in the callback function.

The third function is the reduce function.  It takes in an array and a callback function as it's parameters.  The result will find the sum of all of the numbers in the array provided.

The fourth function is the slice function.  It will take an array, and up to two integers as parameters.  The result will slice out numbers in the array based on the integer arguments provided.
