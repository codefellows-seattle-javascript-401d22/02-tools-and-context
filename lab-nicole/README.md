- The map function takes in two parameters, a callback and a collection (or array).
- It will throw an error if the callback provided was not a function.
- It will throw an error if there is no collection provided.
- When properly used, the reduce method will perform a function that is provided as a callback on each item in the array.

- It will throw an error if the callback provided was not a function.
- It will throw an error if there is no collection provided.
- When properly used, the filter method will filter out items from an array based on the callback provided by the user.

- The map function takes in three parameters, a callback, initial value, and a collection (or array).
- It will throw an error if the callback provided was not a function.
- It will throw an error if there were too few parameters passed to it.
- When properly used, the reduce method will perform a function that is provided as a callback on each item in the array.

- It will throw an error if the starting or ending index provided were not numbers.
